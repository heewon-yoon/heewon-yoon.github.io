I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Columbia University, with research interests in elections, legislative behavior, and candidate selection. My work focuses on examining when and why new electoral rules are adopted and how they affect candidate selection. I use a range of methods in my work, including observational causal inference, surveys, and experiments. My research has been supported by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, the Sylff Association, and the Korea Foundation for Advance Studies. 

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I worked as a research fellow at the Sejong Institute and as a legislative assistant at the National Assembly of The Republic of Korea. I hold an M.A. in Political Science and a B.A. in Political Science and Communications from Korea University.
