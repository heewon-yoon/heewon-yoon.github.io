**Intraparty Conflict and Primary Elections: Evidence from South Korea**

Despite the benefit to party leaders from internally nominating candidates, many parties around the world increasingly turn to primaries to select their candidates. By leveraging the rich variation in South Korea’s legislative elections, where nomination methods differ by district, year, and party, I examine when parties choose primaries over direct appointments using fixed effects regressions.

**Interdistrict Donations and Candidate Selection in U.S. Primaries**

While votes are confined to districts, campaign contributions are not, which offers leeway for out-of-district donors to exert influence. Many candidates heavily rely on out-of-district campaign contributions in elections, but inter-district donations have received less scholarly attention. This paper explores how out-of-district donors affect candidate selection in primary elections. I use natural disasters as an exogenous shock that increases the share of out-of-district donations and examine how it affects candidate selection.

**Gateways or Gatekeepers? Nomination Methods and the Representation of Underrepresented Politicians**

This research examines how different nomination methods shape the representation of underrepresented candidates. While existing research highlights primaries as a more inclusive mechanism—-lowering entry barriers and enabling outsiders to run without party backing-—I show that these benefits are often overstated. In practice, primaries tend to favor well-funded incumbents and politically connected candidates, limiting opportunities for those with fewer resources. By contrast, direct nominations provide a more viable path for underrepresented candidates by shielding them from open competition with better-funded rivals.

**Attitudes toward Immigrants and the Level of Automation** with Younghyun Lee

Many countries face shrinking workforces due to aging populations and low fertility rates, prompting efforts to address labor shortages. Immigration is often promoted as a practical solution, yet negative perceptions persist, fueled by concerns over cultural and social threats. As technological advancements offer an alternative in the form of automation, this research examines when and to what extent automation has been adopted as a substitute for labor. We use cross-national datasets and a survey experiment to examine this.
